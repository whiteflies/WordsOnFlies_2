Our survival depends on the brainâ€™s ability to maximize use of available information at a given moment. Sensory inputs are integrated across and within modalities to improve sensitivity and reduce ambiguity. The precise neural circuit architecture for multisensory integration determines the computations underlying this synergy and therefore the ability of the animal to best respond to challenges from its environment. 

A powerful approach to studying multilevel multimodal interactions is to explore homologous computational processes in Drosophila Larva, an animal model whose brain neural circuits have been mapped and whose neurons are experimentally accessible with genetic and molecular tools for monitoring and manipulating their activity. Additionally,the rich but numerically limited behaviors of the animal simplify behavioural experiments.
